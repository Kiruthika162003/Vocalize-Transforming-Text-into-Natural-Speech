# Vocalize-Transforming-Text-into-Natural-Speech

**Requirements**:

Python: Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download and install Python from the official Python website (https://www.python.org/). The code is compatible with Python 3.x versions.

pyttsx3 Library: You need to install the pyttsx3 library, which is used for text-to-speech conversion in this code. You can install it using pip by running the following command in your command prompt or terminal:


**Code Explanation:**

The pyttsx3 library is imported at the beginning of the code.

The engine object is created using pyttsx3.init() to initialize the text-to-speech engine.

Properties of the speech are set using engine.setProperty(). In the code, we set the speech rate to 150 words per minute ('rate', 150) and the volume level to 0.8 ('volume', 0.8).

The user is prompted to enter the text they want to convert to speech using input(), and the text is stored in the text variable.

The engine.say() function is used to convert the text to speech.

Finally, engine.runAndWait() is called to play the speech.

**Customization:**

You can modify the properties of the speech by adjusting the values in the engine.setProperty() calls. For example, you can change the speech rate or volume to suit your preferences.

Additionally, you can explore the documentation of pyttsx3 to learn about other available functionalities, such as changing the voice, setting callbacks, and handling events during speech synthesis.
